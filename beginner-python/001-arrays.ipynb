    "When you conduct a neuroimaging experiment, the computer that controls the scanner and receives the data from the scanner saves your data to a file. Neuroimaging data appears in many different file formats: `NiFTI`, `Minc`, `Dicom`, etc. These files all contain representations of the data that you collected in the form of an **array**. \n",

    "\n",
    "- *table* means that you will be able to read all or some of the numbers representing your data by addressing the variable that holds your array. It's like addressing a member of your lab to tell you the answer to a question you have, except here you are going to 'ask' a variable in your computer memory. Arrays are usually not as smart as your lab members, but they have very good memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *multi-dimensional* means that you can represent different aspects of your data along different axes. For example, the three dimensions of space can be represented in different dimensions of the table:"
